Hello, fellow Clojurians, and welcome to my newly born blog. Is there a better way to
open the new blog than with a post about my upcoming <a href="http://euroclojure.org/speakers#ddjuric">talk at EuroClojure2016</a>? I decided to put
the slides online in advance, so the attendees can relax and enjoy the talk,
instead of scraping by to type all the notes and memos.
</p>

<p>
The slides are available <a href="http://dragan.rocks/talks/EuroClojure2016/clojure-is-not-afraid-of-the-gpu.html">here</a>, just open them in the web browser (I tested with chromium).
I don't know whether you'd agree with me that Clojure is not afraid of the GPU, but
I hope you'll enjoy my talk and the conference!
</p>

<p>
Please note that there are two directions to browse: down/up, and left/right.
Down/up arrows move you through slides, while left/up arrows move you through
sections. Normally, you'd press down-down-down until there are no more slides,
and then right to cross to the next section.
ESC gives you the bird's view of the structure.
</p>

<p>
Enjoy, and see you in wonderful Bratislava, at awesome EuroClojure conference.
