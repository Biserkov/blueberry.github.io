Uncomplicate libraries have just got a nice update and are ready for the latest underlying platform
releases: CUDA 9, Java 9, and Clojure 1.9.

<p>
I guess it is not difficult to Google it, but <a href="http://neanderthal.uncomplicate.org">here is the Neanderthal homepage</a>. <a href="http://clojurecuda.uncomplicate.org">There is ClojureCUDA home page</a>,
and other <a href="http://www.uncomplicate.org">Uncomplicate projects also have their web pages with documentation and tutorials.</a>
Make sure to check out <a href="http://github.com/uncomplicate">the source code repositories of Uncomplicate libraries at GitHub.</a>

<h2 id="orgf0cc42a">CUDA</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf0cc42a">
<p>
<a href="http://clojurecuda.uncomplicate.org">ClojureCUDA</a> now supports the latest CUDA 9.1. That should eliminate the trouble of downgrading
your CUDA installation to CUDA 8. If you install the latest CUDA toolkit, everything should work
smoothly. If you have CUDA 9.0, it will work. I am not sure about CUDA 8 - even that should work, but
I haven't bothered to try it, since by now CUDA 9 is what most people install by default.
</p>

<p>
Of course, CUDA 9 is also suported in <a href="http://neanderthal.uncomplicate.org">Neanderthal</a>.

<h2 id="org22f08d8">Java 9</h2>

<a href="http://clojurecuda.uncomplicate.org">ClojureCUDA</a>, <a href="http://clojurecl.uncomplicate.org">ClojureCL</a>, and <a href="http://neanderthal.uncomplicate.org">Neanderthal</a> use some JVM internals to manage memory efficiently, which
can clash with Java 9 modules. Fortunately, this has a solution! Include
<code>"--add-opens=java.base/jdk.internal.ref=ALL-UNNAMED"</code> in your JVM options if you use these
libraries with Java 9, and everything will work smoothly, with no code changes required!

<h2 id="org76dba9f">Clojure 1.9</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org76dba9f">

Clojure cares a lot about backward compatibility, so this was not an issue. All Uncomplicate
libraries work with Clojure 1.9 without change.

I have some tutorial articles on GPU programming with Clojure in my warehouse. Now that I don't
have to explain the readers that they have to keep CUDA at the previous version, it seems to be a good moment to
begin releasing them :)
