title: Bayadera = Bayes + Clojure + GPU (slides for my Bob Konferenz 2017 talk)

<p>
Hi Clojurians! I wished I had time to write a few posts since EuroClojure, but I got carried away by
some other stuff (there are a few cool things coming up in the next version of Neanderthal, and
some Clojure CUDA stuff after that!). The good news is that I have more interesting themes
to write about soon!
</p>

<p>
For now, I hope that <a href="http://dragan.rocks/talks/Bobkonferenz2017/bayadera-bob.html">the slides for my upcoming talk</a> at <a href="http://bobkonf.de/2017/djuric.html">Bob Konferenz</a>, that takes place on 24th of February in Berlin
will give you an interesting preview of Bayadera, a Clojure library for high performance Bayesian
Data Analysis.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://dragan.rocks/talks/Bobkonferenz2017/bayadera-bob.html">The slides are available here</a>, just open them in the web browser. You can also read <a href="http://bobkonf.de/2017/djuric.html">the abstract of the talk here.</a>
</p>

<p>
Please note that there are two directions to browse: down/up, and left/right.
Down/up arrows move you through slides, while left/up arrows move you through
sections. Normally, you'd press down-down-down until there are no more slides,
and then right to cross to the next section.
ESC gives you the bird's view of the structure.
