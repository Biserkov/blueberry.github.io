The videos for EuroClojure 2016 talks are finally available on YouTube. Here is mine:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEOOYbscyTs">Clojure is not afraid of the GPU</a>.
It is a nice overview of Uncomplicate libraries: <a href="http://neanderthal.uncomplicate.org">Neanderthal</a>, <a href="http://clojurecl.uncomplicate.org">ClojureCL</a>, and <a href="http://bayadera.uncomplicate.org">Bayadera</a>.
If you have any question regarding this specific talk, or some of the libraries, please contact me (via twitter, email, githug).

The conference was very well organized, talks covering a wide area. There was something for everyone.
I hope I'll see you at some of the next meetings.
